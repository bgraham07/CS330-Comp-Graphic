How do I approach designing software? For me personally I try and break down the requirements into smaller, more manageable pieces.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? I learned a lot with my ability to design structured layouts and rearranging objects.

What design process did you follow for your project work? I followed an iterative process by starting with basic shapes and then adding to those. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? I believe this approach can be applied to furture projects.

How do I approach developing programs? I like following an agile and icremental testing/progress approach.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? I used gradula enhancements on this project and refining from there.

How did iteration factor into your development? It's a critical role and is huge when it comes to debugging.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? I learned a lot through these milestones and learned OpenGL.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? It's teaching me the process of building projects and will further enhance my goals towards Product Owner > Product Manager > and someday Solutions Architect

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? This project heavily taught me to use OpenGL for graphics and this can be applied to future projects

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? Understand how these interact with things like VR, animation, etc and continuing to expand on these skills to build more complex applications.
